# Reign of Nether: Minecraft as an RTS

Inspired the classic Real Time Strategy games of the early 2000s including Starcraft, Warcraft and Age of Empires, Reign of Nether is trying to transform Minecraft into a experience just like one of them using all the same assets and models you find in the vanilla game.

Reign of Nether doesn't try to imitate one of these games exactly, but instead aims to have uniquely-minecraft features. For example, buildings health is proportional to their blocks placed and all units are based on vanilla Minecraft mobs like Illagers, Creepers, and Piglins.
